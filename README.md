# AtEnrich

AtEnrich is a simple command-line tool for calculating enrichment of gene lists or clusters of genes across a variety of curated gene lists from functional genomic experiments.

### Prerequisites

This software requires the numpy, scipy, and pandas packages. These will be installed automatically through pip installation if not already installed.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
pip install atenrich
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running AtEnrich

AtEnrich can be run from the command line either for enrichment of a single gene list against a background gene list, or enrichment across a set of clusters. In list mode:

```
example
```

Here, 'list_filename' is a plaintext file of the form:

```
specification
```

In cluster mode:

```
example
```

Here, 'cluster_filename' is a plaintext file of the form:
